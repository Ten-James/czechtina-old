# V0165 test

In version 0.1.6.5 was add support for `++` and `--` operators.
Also was added support for `+=` and others.

```
main {
    b:int = 0
    b += 1
    ++b
    c = new int, 5
}
```
Should be translated to:
```c
int main() {
	int b = 0;
	b += 1;
	++b;
	int* c = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
	if(c)free(c);
}
```
